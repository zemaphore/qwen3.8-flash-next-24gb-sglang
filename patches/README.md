# SGLang patches

Each script edits the patched SGLang checkout (`$SGLANG`, default `~/quant/sglang`; the `SG = ...`
line at the top of the file) by exact string replacement and supports `apply`, `revert` and `--check`; the module
docstring of every script explains its mechanism and its environment variables. `--check` only reads
the tree. The tree they were measured on is SGLang at commit `73a255206f` ("Introduce Qwen 3.8 Flash
Next") plus the base patch.

## Base layer

`base/sglang-qwen4exp-2bit.patch` is the pre-campaign base patch (the 32k-context state of `docs/WRITEUP.md`)
(604 lines across 15 files): the 2-bit unpack in `fused_moe_kernel_gptq_awq`, the 2-bit `moe_wna16`
loader, the MoE-aware `ExpertStreamer` (`expert_stream.py`), the mmap PLE embedding mode, the offloader
fixes, the `qwen_sparse_attention` allowlist, `packed_modules_mapping` propagation and the `conv_weights`
view fix (`docs/WRITEUP.md` sections 3-5). **It is stale relative to the measured tree**: on 2026-09-03
`git diff --stat` against `73a255206f` shows 28 modified files, 2,954 insertions / 89 deletions, plus six
new modules (`expert_elastic.py`, `expert_gemv.py`, `row_arena.py`, `int8_kv_pool.py`, `int4_kv_pool.py`,
`tiered_kv_pool.py`; `fused_moe_triton_kernels.py.ncontig.orig` is a backup written by `ncontig_gemv.py`,
not source). Whether base patch + the layers below reproduces the tree byte for byte has not been
verified; the layers also depend on each other's wording. **The authoritative artifact is the serving
patch `sglang/qwen4exp-serving-73a255206f.patch`** (34 files, +4,155 / -89; SHA-256
`92f669b2525f9c86190825390fafc2b41a28071c398fcb7fd95716fbce744bb5`), produced from the served tree
on 2026-09-03 and verified in a clean worktree of `73a255206f`: all 34 patched files compare equal to
the served tree (`sglang/PATCH_NOTES.md` section 2). It excludes the `.ncontig.orig` backup but
includes the measurement-only `kv_stats` / `kv_fakeq` hooks and the opt-in `ngram_ple` edits that were
applied in the served tree; `sglang/PATCH_NOTES.md` section 5 gives the exact hunks to drop.

Layering constraints (from the docstrings): `placement` on top of `ncontig`; `elastic` on top of
`placement`; `kv_fp8 < kv_int8 < kv_int4 < kv_tiers` — each `apply()` refuses unless its prerequisite is
fully applied, and each `revert()` refuses while a later layer is applied. `--check` of an overlaid layer
prints its overlaid edits as MISMATCH and a `P-line` naming the overlay; that is the expected state, not
damage.

## Accepted post-campaign PP layers

The original `assets/phase1_state.json` list above predates the RTX 3090 PP
campaign. The current served tree also has these later layers applied in their
documented order: PLE bulk pread and recent-row cache, gather block 2048, PP7
host DMA gather, PP11 batched DMA, presence placement, PP12 chunk 4608, and
PP14 cross-layer cold-row prefetch.

| Item | Source patch | Launcher patch | Accepted behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| PP14 cold prefetch | `moe_cross_layer_prefetch.py` | `enable_moe_cross_layer_prefetch.py` | One reusable ~637 MiB device cache overlaps the next layer's fixed cold-row HtoD with current MoE compute. Default on only at >=2,048 tokens; `SGLANG_MOE_COLD_PREFETCH=0` restores selected-row DMA. Exact; +36.32% canonical PP versus adjacent control, 68.9k prompt passed, trace overlap 0.46% -> 51.70%. |

PP14 applies after `moe_host_dma_batch.py` because it reuses that layer's
stable pinned-source address cache and `cudaMemcpyBatchAsync` helper. Revert
PP14 before reverting PP11.

## Not in the accepted list

| Item | Script | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ngram_ple` | `ngram_ple.py` | **opt-in** (currently applied in the measured tree, inert without `--speculative-algorithm NGRAM`) | NGRAM speculation with the PLE: guard drop, linear draft chain, PLE-state commit after verify (also a real bug for MTP topk = 1 under replayssm), startup self-check. Lossless within the decode-vs-prefill floor; accept length 1.11-1.27 -> 22-25 tok/s vs 56 (CAMPAIGN.md:387). Serve flags in the docstring. |
| `kv_stats` | `kv_stats.py` | **measurement-only** (edit 0 applied, edit 1 clean) | per-layer/head K/V statistics at `set_kv_buffer` (`SGLANG_KV_STATS=/path.pt`), the design data for the KV panel |
| `kv_fakeq` | `kv_fakeq.py` | **measurement-only** (applied, env-gated) | fake quantization on the bf16 pool's write path (`SGLANG_KV_FAKEQ=int8_g64|int8_tok|int8_g32|e4m3|int4_g32|...|zero|noise`); must run with `--kv-cache-dtype auto` (ERRATUM, CAMPAIGN.md:394). The smoothing statistics file is read from `SGLANG_KV_STATS_FILE` only; the served tree (and the flat patch) carried the measuring host's default path in that line, so `kv_fakeq.py --check` against the served tree reports edit 1 as MISMATCH |
| `dump`, `moedump` | `host_fixes.py` items | **measurement-only** (clean, not applied) | routing dump (`SGLANG_ROUTE_DUMP`, consumed by `tools/expert_freq.py`) and per-layer MoE I/O dumps for kernel A/Bs |
| `kv_paged_prefix` | `kv_paged_prefix.py` | **rejected** (clean, not applied) | paged prefix-chunk prefill kernel reading the int8/int4/tiered pools in-kernel; correct within 2 row-ulps, but 6.1 ms (tiered) / 3.2 (int8) / 4.2 (int4) vs 1.4 ms materialised per head-layer at prefix 60k (CAMPAIGN.md:439; `docs/KV_PAGED_PREFIX_PLAN.md` "Outcome") |

## Serving assets the accepted layers need

* `assets/moe_configs/` — tuned Triton configs for `dtype=int2_w2a16` / `int2_w2a16_down` at E = 10
  (decode) and E = 512 (prefill), `SGLANG_MOE_CONFIG_DIR` (S0b, +13 % decode, CAMPAIGN.md:252).
* `assets/expert_freq.pt` — routing-mass histogram `[48, 512]`, selectable
  through `SGLANG_MOE_PLACEMENT`.
* `assets/expert_presence_code.pt` — PP5c code-prompt presence placement and
  the general launcher default via
  `patches/enable_prefill_presence_placement.py` (+5.17% over pooled mass
  controls on the training prompt and PP11 stack; held-out code -0.91%/+1.47%,
  non-material, exact oracles; workload-specific).
* a writable control file for `SGLANG_MOE_ELASTIC_CTL` (contents `S 184`; the server writes
  `<file>.status`).

## Rules

* No server starts while a patch workflow is applying or reverting (CAMPAIGN.md:420, :435-436).
* Revert layered patches in reverse; `scripts/phase1.py` does this and aborts on a refusal.
* The model-side change is not a patch: `scripts/requant_int8.py` re-packed 85 dense
  tensors (`linear_attn.out_proj` x36, `self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj` x12 each, `lm_head`) to INT8 g128 RTN
  into the served directory (S11b, CAMPAIGN.md:298-300).
